# GhostFinder  
**Version 0.01**
## Introduction
GhostFinder is a simplistic Idle game with an RPG focus. This application was made within about 7-8 hours for a project within my Mobile App Dev course. As it stands, it is a complete mess but to me it portrays my childhood passion for games as well as a culmination of some parts of what I learned in this course.

The app is in most extreme prototype version as of now and the beta version will hopefully be done some time August. With that said, I hope you enjoy slaying some ghosts in the meantime!
